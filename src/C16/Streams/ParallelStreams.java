//    Primary reason is to improve performance, but remaining same or compatible result.
//    Executed by different threads, running on multiple CPU cores in a computer.

//    Factors affecting performance

//    Benchmarking: measuring performance
//    3 factors in deciding whether a stream should be executed in parallel:
//    (1) sufficiently large data size
//    (2) computation-intensive stream operations.
//    (3) Easily splittable stream: ArraysLists, HashMaps & simple arrays are efficiently splittable.
//      whereas LinkedList, IO-based resources are less efficient in this regard.

// Note that only final or effectively final variables can be referenced within lambda expressions
